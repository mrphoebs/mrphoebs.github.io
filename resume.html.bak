			<div id="profile" class="block">
				Technical architect, researcher and former entrepreneur. I'm a passionate hacker that loves creating elegant solutions to address difficult problems. 
				A self starter, I thrive on end to end ownership. A unique hodge podge of research, business and technology experience has imbued me with a great width and
				depth of experience. I'm a generalist interested in many domains and likes to go deep into a problem domain from time to time. I'm an open-source contributor
				and have been an avid technologist for more than a decade.

				<p> I own and drive the tech mandate for End-to-End experience team. I've designed and built multiple platforms and systems that are widely used at Flipkart 
				to deliver critical functionality. Some of them include...</p>
			       
				<p><b>Lego:</b> Lego is a highly performant, highly scalable (in terms of traffic and developers) and resilient  application framework. It is an incredibly flexible
				framework that is used by multiple teams at flipkart and is deployed in different shapes on over a thousand servers. These installations are combinedly capable of handling upto 2 
				billion requests per hour. This is one of the critical systems that made the festive season and events like Big Billion Day possible at an unprecedented scale.</p>
			       
				<p><b>Igor:</b> Is a platform to curate 100s of thousands of online stores comprised of millions of products while processing billions of product updates. 
				It delivers low latency entity processing with tremendous visibility and fine grained control over the data processing pipeline. It provides strict processing 
				and fairness garuntees in a multitenant setting while minimizing operational overhead. All of flipkart's stores are managed by this platform.</p>
