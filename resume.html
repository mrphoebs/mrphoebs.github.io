				Technical architect, researcher and former entrepreneur. I'm a passionate hacker and love creating elegant solutions for difficult problems. 
				A self starter, I thrive on end to end ownership. A unique hodge podge of research, business and technology experience has imbued me with a great width and
				depth of experience. I'm a generalist who is interested in many domains and I like to go deep into a problem domain from time to time. I'm an open-source contributor
				and have been an avid technologist for more than a decade.

				<p> I am part of the tech-infra team, that's creating Software Defined Infra and Services in our new DC. I used own and drive the tech mandate for the End-to-End 
				experience team. I've designed, built and owned multiple platforms and systems that are widely used at Flipkart to deliver critical functionality. Some of them include...</p>

				<p><b>IaaS Compute:</b> I own and am responsible for Flipkart's Elastic Compute Platform. This along with our ELB are fundamental IaaS primitives on top of which
				All our PaaS components and customer applications are deployed. Our recent work has centered around improving utilization through better fitment and to address the tech/domain debt accumulated 
				in our run up to last year's Big Billion Days.</p>

				<p><b>Scotty:</b> Deployment and change management service that enables an immutable infra paradigm in the cloud. It coordinates and governs infra and release assets to achieve, 
				correct, predictable, well controlled deployments and change management on SDI(Software Defined Infra). It is designed to do it's job without communicating with atomic units of infra 
				which makes it trivially scalable and able to handle change management for 100s of thousands of infra assets, simultaneously.</p>

				<p><b>Repo-svc:</b> A generic post build release service that's used to publish and consume binary release assets in a well defined manner. Release artifacts are published into versioned 
				repos which can further be used to compose versioned environments which make up the Universe of released assets for associated deployments. The design of repo-svc allows for repeatable
				and predictable deployments by enforcing well defined immutable environments comprised of release assets.</p>
			       
				<p><b>Lego:</b> Lego is a highly performant, highly scalable (in terms of traffic and developers) and resilient  application framework. It is an incredibly flexible
				framework that is used by multiple teams at Flipkart and is deployed in different shapes on over a thousand bare-metal servers. These installations are combinedly capable of handling upto 2 
				billion requests per hour. This is one of the critical systems that make the festive season and events like Big Billion Day possible at an unprecedented scale.</p>
			       
				<p><b>Igor:</b> Is a platform to curate upto a 100,000 online stores comprised of millions of products while processing billions of product updates. 
				It delivers low latency entity processing with tremendous visibility and fine grained control over the data processing pipeline. It provides strict processing 
				and fairness guarantees in a multi-tenant setting while minimizing operational overhead. All of Flipkart's stores are managed by this platform.</p>
