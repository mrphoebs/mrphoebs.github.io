				<div class="hed">Udaan</div>
				<div class="subhed by2"> Engineering </div><div class="duration by2">Jan 2017 - Dec 2019</div>

				<p>I joined udaan 6 months after it's inception and have been part of the tech team for 3 years. I've owned Customer Feed and Buyer Network products at udaan in the past
					but My most impactful contribution at udaan has been the Creation and rapid growth of our Fulfillment Center/Warehousing function and product. </p>

				<p><b>Warehousing:</b>
					In the early part of 2017 Our Intracity Food Business was moving from strength to strength and was seriously taxing our intracity supply chain logistics from a sheer capacity
					perspective. It was clear we would not be able to scale with our existing supply chain paradigm in intracity for more than a couple of months at most. From this emerged a 
					tactical need to immediately move to a Warehousing centered supply chain paradigm. Beyond the immediate need we were certain that fulfillment centers and udaan managed fulfillment
					would play a vital strategic role in our evolving supply chain and fulfillment story. With this in mind I got to work building our Warehousing system from scratch and started our 
					first warehouse by the end of the quarter. From these humble beginnings we've grown to more than 80 fulfillment centers across india for categories as varied as Staples, FMCG, Fresh Vegetables,
					Pharma, Home & Kitchen, Mobiles, Stationary, Clothing & Lifestyle. With Fulfillment Centers as a core construct we have been able to build open and  closed box supply chains 
					for our intracity and intercity category needs with an O2D ranging from a few hours to a few days. This rapid growth in variety, scale and reach of our managed fulfillment offering
					would not have been possible without a fulfillment center product that provided the required flexibility in constructs across archetypes while also delivering on the core needs of 
					each archetype.

				<div class="hed">Flipkart</div> 
				<div class="subhed by2"> Technical Architect </div><div class="duration by2">April 2012 - Dec 2016</div>
				<p> I was part of the tech-infra team, that's created Software Defined Infra and Services in our new DC. I used to own and drive the tech mandate for the End-to-End 
				experience team. I've designed, built and owned multiple platforms and systems that are widely used at Flipkart to deliver critical functionality. Some of them include...</p>

				<p><b>IaaS Compute:</b> I've owned and was responsible for Flipkart's Elastic Compute Platform. This along with our ELB are fundamental IaaS primitives on top of which
				All our PaaS components and customer applications are deployed. My latest work has centered around compute platform resource management and orchestration aimed at improving 
				utilization through better fitment, resource utilization to enable flexibility and decrease costs while delivering predictable compute resources for peak scenarios like 
				Big Billion Days.</p>

				<p><b>Scotty:</b> Deployment and change management service that enables an immutable infra paradigm in the cloud. It coordinates and governs infra and release assets to achieve, 
				correct, predictable, well controlled deployments and change management on SDI(Software Defined Infra). It is designed to do it's job without communicating with atomic units of infra 
				which makes it trivially scalable and able to handle change management for 100s of thousands of infra assets, simultaneously.</p>

				<p><b>Repo-svc:</b> A generic post build release service that's used to publish and consume binary release assets in a well defined manner. Release artifacts are published into versioned 
				repos which can further be used to compose versioned environments which make up the Universe of released assets for associated deployments. The design of repo-svc allows for repeatable
				and predictable deployments by enforcing well defined immutable environments comprised of release assets.</p>
			       
				<p><b>Lego:</b> Lego is a highly performant, highly scalable (in terms of traffic and developers) and resilient  application framework. It is an incredibly flexible
				framework that is used by multiple teams at Flipkart and is deployed in different shapes on over a thousand bare-metal servers. These installations are combinedly capable of handling upto 2 
				billion requests per hour. This is one of the critical systems that make the festive season and events like Big Billion Day possible at an unprecedented scale.</p>
			       
				<p><b>Igor:</b> Is a platform to curate upto a 100,000 online stores comprised of millions of products while processing billions of product updates. 
				It delivers low latency entity processing with tremendous visibility and fine grained control over the data processing pipeline. It provides strict processing 
				and fairness guarantees in a multi-tenant setting while minimizing operational overhead. All of Flipkart's stores are managed by this platform.</p>
